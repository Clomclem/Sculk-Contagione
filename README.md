# Sculk Contagione

A mod that makes Sculk more, lets say, invasive.

This mod was inspired by Sculkhunt & Sculk Horde, and aims to make a vanilla-esque infection mod.

### Features

- Sculk absorbs non-sculk items, and damages entities without boots.
- Sculk catalyst now spreads automatically, has way more range (64 blocks instead of 16) and is more aggresive when spreading, can produce more catalysts, and gives spores to nearby entities, which if not cured with milk, kills the entity and turns it into a catalyst.
- Sculk shriekers spawned by a catalyst can now spawn Wardens.
- When spreading, Sculk catalysts can convert almost any block into Sculk.

You can configure things like timings and the amount of Sculk that spreads using Gamerules (see [this](src/main/resources/assets/sculkcontagione/lang/en_us.json)).
